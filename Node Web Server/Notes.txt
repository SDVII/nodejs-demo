1) You need to install "Express" module to create a web server.
2) You can run the server by executing: (nodemon build/server.js).
    - You need to have nodemon installed globally in order for this command to work
3) You can use a template engine to inject variables into html files, like "HandlebarsJS"
4) you can use services like "Heroku" to host your applications.
    - Download heroku cli tools.
    - Login: run (heroku login)
    - Create ssh key: run (heroku keys:add)
    - Create app: run in root (heroku create)
    - Deploy app: run (git push heroku)
    - Open app: run (heroku open -a APP)
    * This won't work with the current setup because multiple projects are contained inside the repo. you might need this for the ts as well: https://github.com/zidizei/heroku-buildpack-tsc
